  <hr>
  <p id="whereishe-text">
Since bursting on the Silicon Valley scene more than two decades ago, the 50-year-old serial entrepreneur has kept the public captivated with his business antics.

Born in South Africa, Mr Musk showed his talents for entrepreneurship early, going door to door with his brother selling homemade chocolate Easter eggs and developing his first computer game at the age of 12.

He has described his childhood as difficult, coloured by his parents' divorce, bullying at school and his own difficulty reading social cues due to Asperger's Syndrome. He soon fled home for college, moving to Canada and then the US, where he studied economics and physics at the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League college.<p>

  <h2 id="money-title">How did Elon Musk make his money?</h2>
  <hr>
  <p id="money-text">
After being accepted to a physics graduate degree programme at Stanford University, Mr Musk quickly dropped out and founded two technology start-up companies during the "dot com boom" of the 1990s. These included a web software firm and an online banking company that eventually became PayPal, which sold to eBay in 2002 for $1.5bn.

He ploughed his fortune into a new rocket company, SpaceX, which he aimed to make a cost-effective alternative to Nasa, and a new electric car company, Tesla, where he chaired the board until becoming chief executive in 2008.</p>

  <h2 id="worth-title">How much is Elon Musk worth?</h2>
  <hr>
  <p id="worth-text">All the messiness appears to be part of his appeal - and it certainly hasn't stopped him from amassing a fortune.

Forbes and Bloomberg now rank him as the world's richest person, with a net worth of about $250bn - tens of millions more than his nearest rival, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

That's based largely on the value of his shares in Tesla, of which he owns about 17%. The company's stock has exploded in value - some say unreasonably - since the start of 2020, rising by a factor of 10 as the firm's output increased and it started to deliver regular profits.</p>
